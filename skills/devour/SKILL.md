Devour is a principles-driven, lineage-aware design engineering review. It is opinionated, citation-heavy, and built for designer-engineers who want a second pair of eyes calibrated to a higher bar. Every finding traces back to a named principle and a real source. Nothing is left at "this looks better."

This skill does not invent. It compresses a body of work spanning 40+ years of design thought into a usable review heuristic.

---

## When to use

- The user wants design review on a specific component, page, or flow ("review this dialog," "look at the onboarding").
- The user just shipped or is about to ship and wants a craft pass.
- The user mentions one of: polish, taste, craft, design engineering, motion review, micro-interactions, principles review.
- The user references the lineage by name: Rams, Tufte, Norman, Rauno, Emil, Sonner, Vaul, cmdk, Linear, Arc, Vercel.

For *general* AI-aesthetic-removal polish, the [`impeccable`](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) family of skills (`polish`, `animate`, `delight`, `bolder`, `harden`) is the right tool. Devour is for principles review with citations.

For accessibility audits, a checklist tool (`rams`, `web-design-guidelines`, `a11y-debugging`) is faster and more comprehensive than devour for that specific purpose. Devour will flag obvious a11y failures as part of principle #6 (ergonomics) but is not an a11y audit.

---

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Before reviewing anything, devour requires project context. Different products live in different parts of the spine ... a marketing page values principles 9 and 12 most; a productivity app values 3, 4, and 7 most; a creative tool values 2 and 5 most. Without context, devour produces generic findings.

**If the project has not run `/devour-teach` yet:**

1. STOP. Do not proceed with review.
2. Tell the user: "Devour needs project context first. Running `/devour-teach` to set up."
3. Invoke `devour-teach`. Follow it through to completion.
4. Then return to this skill.

**If the project has already run `/devour-teach`:**

A `Devour Context` block will exist in `.devour-context.md` (the canonical location) or, if the consumer has linked it, in their loaded project instructions (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.). Read it before doing review. The context names which principles weight highest for this product and which exemplars are most relevant.

---

## Process

**Always execute this process from scratch on each invocation.** If prior devour output exists in session memory, ignore it. Re-read targets, re-run Step 1a browser-MCP detection, re-verify findings. Never reproduce, paraphrase, or replay cached output from a prior run. The codebase may have changed since the last review (fixes applied, new commits), and even if it has not, the verification itself is the review. If the user asks to "re-run," "run again," "check again," or similar, they are asking for a fresh execution of the full process, not a reprint of the last output.

### Step 0a ... Resolve target repo (`--repo`)

Read `$ARGUMENTS`. If `--repo <path>` is present:

1. Extract `<path>` as the value.
2. Strip `--repo <path>` from `$ARGUMENTS` before passing to later steps.
3. Validate: the path must exist and be a directory. If it does not: stop and report `--repo path does not exist: <path>. Aborting.`
4. Set `$REPO` = the absolute `<path>`.

If `--repo` is not present: set `$REPO` = current working directory.

For the rest of this skill:
- All file reads, relative-path resolutions, and project-local lookups use `$REPO` as the root.
- Git commands run with `git -C $REPO ...`.
- `.devour-context.md` reads from `$REPO/.devour-context.md`.
- `.devour/runs/` writes to `$REPO/.devour/runs/`.
- `package.json` reads from `$REPO/package.json`.
- If a target argument is a relative path, resolve it against `$REPO`. If absolute, use as-is.

If `$REPO` is not a git repository (no `.git/` directory inside), warn the user once:
`Note: $REPO is not a git repo. Skipping diff-based default. Provide a target file or pattern.`
Then proceed with code review, but do not attempt `git diff` defaults.

### Step 0 ... Check for --terse flag

Read `$ARGUMENTS`. If `--terse` is present, set output mode to **terse**. Strip `--terse` from the arguments before passing them to Step 1. Terse mode keeps the same rigor and the same spine but strips teaching prose from each finding. The APPLY? prompt and INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FINDINGS block are unchanged in both modes.

### Step 1 ... Establish target

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided (after stripping `--terse`), the target is that file, component, pattern, or URL. Read it.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:

- Default to **changed files in the target repo's current branch** (`git -C $REPO diff main..HEAD --name-only`, filtered to design-relevant files: `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.html`, `.astro`).
- If the current branch has no changes, do NOT fall back to replaying a prior review. Ask the user what to review. Suggest natural targets based on the repo: recent commits (`git log --oneline -10`) often reveal which surfaces have been actively worked on. Also check for a prior review target in session context... if the user ran `/devour` recently on specific files, those are natural candidates for a fresh re-execution. Offer options; wait for the user to pick before proceeding.

#### Step 1a ... Detect a browser-driving MCP

Before reading any code, check whether any browser-driving MCP is available in your tool set. Devour does not require a specific browser MCP; any tool family that lets you open pages, navigate, and evaluate scripts will work.

Common browser MCPs to look for, by tool-name prefix:

- `mcp__chrome-devtools__*` (chrome-devtools-mcp ... most common)
- `mcp__playwright__*` (Playwright MCP)
- `mcp__browser__*` or `mcp__browser-mcp__*` (BrowserMCP)
- `mcp__browserbase__*` (Browserbase)
- `mcp__puppeteer__*` (Puppeteer MCP)

The minimum capabilities devour needs are: open a URL, evaluate JavaScript on the page, and take a DOM snapshot (accessibility tree or equivalent structured representation). Screenshots are optional and should be used sparingly... DOM inspection is faster, more precise, and cheaper for almost every devour finding. Use `evaluate_script` to read exact values (`getBoundingClientRect`, `getComputedStyle`, inline styles, DOM attributes, `performance.now()`) rather than reading pixels from an image. Different MCPs name these capabilities differently. Identify the relevant tools by capability, not by exact name.

**DOM-first rule:** for any finding devour can verify by inspecting DOM attributes, computed styles, class names, rect sizes, timing functions, or event handlers, use `evaluate_script` or `take_snapshot` rather than a screenshot. Reserve screenshots for findings that genuinely require visual judgment the DOM cannot express (font rendering quirks, compositing artifacts, cross-browser pixel-level differences). Motion timing, touch target size, hover state presence, backdrop opacity, token compliance, and stagger intervals are all DOM-verifiable. Screenshots of these waste context and rarely produce signal the DOM did not already provide.

**If NO browser-driving MCP is available:**

Tell the user once, plainly: "I don't have a browser-driving MCP available in this session, so this will be a code-only review. Motion, ergonomic, overlay, and state findings need browser verification. To enable that, install any browser MCP (chrome-devtools, Playwright, BrowserMCP, etc.) and re-run."

Then proceed with code-only review. Mark the output `Reviewed: code only`.

**If a browser MCP IS available:**

Try the equivalent of `list_pages` first. Three cases:

1. **A page matching the dev server is already open** (look for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or a known dev URL from `package.json`'s `dev` script): use it. Select/focus it.
2. **No matching page is open, but you can find the dev server URL** (read `$REPO/package.json`, look for `next dev`, `vite`, `pnpm dev`, port hints; default to `http://localhost:3000` for Next/Vite, `http://localhost:5173` for Vite, `http://localhost:5174` for Astro): open it.
3. **No dev server detectable**: ask the user once: "What URL is your dev server on?" If the user doesn't have one running, fall back to code-only and mark accordingly.

Mark the output `Reviewed: code + browser (<MCP name>)` once you have a live page.

**When a browser MCP IS available and a dev server is running:**

For any finding that depends on runtime behavior, **do the browser verification before emitting the finding**. This applies to:

- Motion timing and felt timing (principles #1, #2, #5)
- Hover delay behavior and intent commit (principle #3)
- Touch target hit areas (principle #6)
- Overlay/modal/dialog behavior and metaphor fit (principle #11)
- State transitions, optimistic rollback, and route-change behavior (principles #4, #7)

Rules:

- If verification **confirms** the issue: emit the finding tagged `[browser-confirmed]`.
- If verification **shows no issue**: do NOT emit the finding. The code-based hypothesis was wrong; observation overrides it.
- Do NOT emit findings that say "verify in browser first" or "test this in browser." The skill has browser access; it does that work itself.

Findings that are reliably code-confirmable (principles #9, #10, #12, and most of #8) may be emitted as `[code-confirmed]` without browser verification.

**When a browser MCP IS available but NO dev server is running:**

Ask the user once: "I have browser MCP access but no dev server. Should I try to detect a running instance, or should I proceed with code-only review?" If they provide a URL, use it. Otherwise proceed code-only.

#### Step 1b ... Read the code

After environment is established, read the target file(s) in full. For each target file, you will need:

- The current code
- Any related design system tokens or shared components
- Any visible production state (the live page via browser MCP if available, or a deployed preview otherwise)

### Step 2 ... Apply the spine

The spine is twelve principles. Each principle has tactics (positive patterns) and anti-patterns (failure modes). The full treatment lives in `references/principles/<principle-N>.md` ... read these as you encounter findings.

For each principle, scan the target for both:
- **Anti-pattern matches** ... the failure mode the principle is designed to catch
- **Tactic gaps** ... places where the right tactic is missing

The twelve principles, in spine order:

1. **Honest motion** ... if you animate it, it must communicate something the static state could not
2. **Physics over duration** ... real movement has mass, springs, damping; eased durations betray themselves
3. **Commit on intent, not on contact** ... distinguish hover-passing-through from hover-with-intent
4. **Reversibility is craft** ... every optimistic state needs a believable error path
5. **Sequence carries meaning** ... stagger only when order matters
6. **The fingertip and the cursor are not the same** ... Fitts, hit boxes, ergonomic distance
7. **Preserve user state across boundaries** ... loading must not lose your scroll, your selection, your draft
8. **Make affordances visible without making them loud** ... signifiers should be discoverable, not declarative
9. **Reduce decoration, increase information** ... every element earns its pixels
10. **Density is a craft choice, not a default** ... choose intentionally
11. **Match the metaphor to the medium** ... do not paginate what should scroll
12. **Type is a system, not a decision per element** ... scale, leading, weight, optical sizing follow rules

Citation map for each principle is in [`references/principles-map.md`](../../references/principles-map.md).

**Weighting:** Apply the project's `Devour Context` to weight which principles to look hardest for. A landing page rarely fails #4 (reversibility) but often fails #9 (decoration). A productivity tool rarely fails #12 (type system) but often fails #3 (intent). Don't waste the user's attention on principles that don't apply to their context.

### Step 3 ... Write findings

Each finding follows this structure:

```
[#N PRINCIPLE NAME] - <severity>
File: <path>:<line range>
Symptom:
  <one or two sentences describing what you observe in the code/UI>
Principle:
  <one sentence stating the principle and what it requires here>
Tactic:
  <the specific change that would address this>
  ```<code or pseudo-code showing the fix>```
Reference:
  <citation to references/principles/<file>.md, plus the canonical exemplar from the lineage>
```

**Severity scale:**

- **🔴 BREAKS** ... the principle is violated in a way that visibly hurts the user. Reversibility error path missing. Touch target unreachable. State lost on navigation.
- **🟡 DRIFTS** ... the principle is not catastrophically violated but the surface is drifting toward sloppiness. Hover commits too fast. Type scale has crept to four sizes. Decoration is creeping.
- **🟢 OPPORTUNITY** ... the principle is not violated but there's a higher-craft move available. Spring physics where you have eased duration. Stagger where current motion is simultaneous (or vice versa).

**Finding annotation:** Each finding should be tagged immediately after the severity marker:

- `[code-confirmed]` ... finding was verified from static code alone
- `[browser-confirmed]` ... finding was verified by driving the live UI via browser MCP

If no browser MCP is available, all findings are `[code-confirmed]`. If browser MCP is available, findings touching motion (#1, #2, #5), ergonomics (#3, #6), overlay/metaphor behavior (#11), and state transitions (#4, #7) should be `[browser-confirmed]` by actually running the check before emitting the finding.

### Step 4 ... Look for inter-finding conflicts

Before writing the final output, scan the findings for interactions. Two findings can be in tension when:

- **Fixing one weakens the other** (e.g., extending a stagger ceiling fixes the cutoff but leaves the broader re-animation problem unresolved)
- **Both have the same root cause** and a single structural change resolves both, but it's bigger than either finding individually
- **Tactics conflict** (one says "add motion here," another says "remove motion there")
- **Findings cluster around an architectural pattern** (multiple violations from the same misuse)

When you find an interaction, surface it explicitly in a dedicated block (see Step 5 output format). Don't quietly apply structural changes at apply-time without the user knowing they were the only path. Honest review names trade-offs before they happen.

### Step 5 ... Output format

**Default (verbose):** Each finding includes symptom, principle explanation, tactic with code, and reference with full exemplar prose. Use this unless `--terse` was set.

**Terse mode (`--terse`):** Each finding is compressed to six lines. No exemplar paragraph, no extended explanation. Same severity markers, same principle and source citations, same APPLY? and INTERACTIONS blocks.

Terse finding format:
```
🔴 / 🟡 / 🟢  File: <path>:<line>
Symptom: <one sentence>
Principle: #N <name>
Source: <Designer>, "<Work>"
Tactic: <one sentence>
```

The header block, severity groupings, INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FINDINGS block, SUMMARY block, and APPLY? block all remain in terse mode, unchanged.

**Verbose output format (default):**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
DEVOUR REVIEW: <target>
Context: <project context summary in one line>
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔴 BREAKS (N findings)

🟡 DRIFTS (N findings)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
SUMMARY
N breaks · N drifts · N opportunities

  2. Apply all 🔴 + 🟡 (N findings)
  3. Apply everything (N findings)
  4. Cherry-pick ... tell me which (e.g., "1, 3, and 5" or "the featured badge fix")
  5. Review only ... apply nothing
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

After printing the review, **always print the APPLY? block as the final lines of output.** Do not skip it. The block names the user's options explicitly so they don't have to guess what's possible.

If code-only (no browser MCP found or no dev server), append above the APPLY? block: "Reviewed code only. Motion, ergonomic, overlay, and state findings above need browser verification before you trust them. Re-run with a browser MCP + dev server to confirm."

### Step 6 ... Save the run to file (streaming, compaction-safe)

Devour writes each invocation's output as a "run" file under `$REPO/.devour/runs/`. The file is written incrementally as the review proceeds, not just at the end. This makes runs durable against session compaction or abort, and makes them resumable. See Step 0b for resume behavior.

**Location:** `$REPO/.devour/runs/<YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS>-devour-<target-slug>.md` relative to the target repo root.

- `<YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS>` is the current UTC timestamp, ISO-8601-like but filename-safe (no colons). Example: `2026-04-23T164500`.
- `<target-slug>` is derived from the review target. Slugify the target path: replace `/` with `-`, lowercase, strip unsafe characters, keep under 40 chars. For diff-based default targets, use `diff-main-HEAD`. For whole-repo reviews, use `repo-full`.

**Directory creation:** if `$REPO/.devour/` or `$REPO/.devour/runs/` does not exist, create the nested structure. Never write outside `$REPO`.

**File lifecycle:**

1. **At run start** (after Step 1 target is established): create the run file with this scaffolding. Write this and save immediately.

```markdown
---
status: in-progress
started: <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp>
completed: null
skill: devour
target: <human-readable target description>
repo: <$REPO absolute path>
context-file: <path to .devour-context.md if read, else null>
browser-mcp: <detected MCP short name if any, else null>
terse: <true|false>
---

# Devour run: <target>

## Context

<empty; filled in Step 2 or equivalent>

## Findings

<empty; findings appended one at a time in Step 3>

## Interactions between findings

<empty; filled in Step 4>

## Apply decisions

<empty; filled after APPLY? prompt is answered>

## Outcomes

<empty; filled after fixes are verified>
```

2. **After context is gathered** (end of Step 2): write the Context section atomically. Save.

3. **For each finding identified in Step 3**: append the finding to the Findings section in the file's current state. Save after each finding. The finding format in the file mirrors the screen output (verbose or terse per `$TERSE`).

4. **After the findings phase completes** (end of Step 4): write the "Interactions between findings" section atomically. Save.

5. **After the APPLY? prompt is answered** (after Step 5 decision lands): write the Apply decisions section as a markdown table with one row per finding: `| Finding | Decision | Notes |`. Save.

6. **After fixes are verified** (or after the user chooses review-only): write the Outcomes section, flip frontmatter `status` from `in-progress` to `complete`, set `completed` to the current UTC timestamp. Save. This is the final write.

**Announce to the user** at start of run (immediately after scaffolding is written):

> Run started: `$REPO/.devour/runs/<filename>.md`. This file updates live as the review proceeds, so it survives compaction.

At end of run (after status flips to `complete`):

> Run complete: `$REPO/.devour/runs/<filename>.md`.

**Git hygiene:** if `$REPO/.devour/` is not in the project's `.gitignore` and the project uses git, tell the user once at the end of the run: "Consider adding `.devour/` to your `.gitignore`, or commit runs selectively for important ones."

Do NOT auto-add to `.gitignore`. The user decides.

When applying:

- **Show the diff** before each file change. Brief, just the hunks.
- **Apply 🔴 BREAKS without further confirmation** if the user picked option 1, 2, or 3. The principle violation was named; the tactic was specific; the user opted in.
- **Ask once per 🟡 DRIFT or 🟢 OPPORTUNITY** that involves a real taste call (e.g., "the stagger ceiling extends to 20 ... is this the right max for your grids?"). Don't ask if the fix is mechanical.
- **After all fixes are applied, ask if the user wants to commit.** Do not auto-commit.

---

## Sub-skills (the family)

For deeper passes on specific principles, devour has focused sub-skills. Invoke when the user signals depth on a specific axis:

- [`/devour-motion`](../devour-motion/SKILL.md) ... principles #1, #2, #5 (honest motion, physics, sequence)
- [`/devour-micro`](../devour-micro/SKILL.md) ... principles #3, #6, #11 (intent, ergonomics, metaphor)
- [`/devour-state`](../devour-state/SKILL.md) ... principles #4, #7 (reversibility, state preservation)
- [`/devour-teach`](../devour-teach/SKILL.md) ... project context setup (run once per repo)

---

## Anti-fashion stance

Devour is built to age slowly. The spine draws primarily from Layers 1-3 of the lineage, which are decades or centuries old. Layer 4 tactics (Rauno's spring stiffness numbers, Emil's specific easing curves, the latest cmdk pattern) appear only as exemplars, not as principles.

When a Layer 4 tactic becomes outdated ... and it will, every five years or so ... the spine survives. The references folder gets new exemplars. The principles do not change.

This means devour will sometimes give findings that are *unfashionable*. A particular animation pattern might be trendy on Twitter and still fail principle #1 (honest motion). Devour calls that out. The user makes the final call.

---

## Voice

Devour's voice is:

- **Specific** ... cite line numbers, name the principle, point to the source
- **Calm** ... no hype, no superlatives, no emoji-heavy enthusiasm
- **Opinionated but not bossy** ... state the principle, recommend the tactic, leave the call to the user
- **Honest about uncertainty** ... if motion can't be reviewed from code alone, say so
- **Generous with attribution** ... cite the lineage by name, every time

Avoid:

- "This looks better" without principle citation
- "Modern best practice" framing (devour cares about durable practice, not modern practice)
- "Industry standard" hand-waving
- Stacking findings on top of each other without distinguishing severity

---

## Citations are not optional

If a finding cannot be traced to a principle in the spine, it does not belong in the review. The whole skill is built on the claim that good design review is principled, not preferential.

If you find yourself wanting to flag something the spine doesn't cover, two paths:

1. The thing belongs to a different skill (accessibility checklist, performance audit, copy edit). Recommend that skill.
2. The thing reveals a gap in the spine. Note it as a meta-observation at the end of the review and move on. The spine evolves slowly and on purpose; one missing case isn't enough to justify changing it.
